# Collatz Conjecture in R
I already created a programm to calculate the Collatz Conjecture and to display the numbers in a table and graph in javascript.<br />
See [Collatz Conjecture in JavaScript](https://jsapps.fabian-kleine.dev/Collatz-Conjecture/)<br />
But since **R** is a programming language that is more focused on math, I wanted to rebuild the project in **R**.
